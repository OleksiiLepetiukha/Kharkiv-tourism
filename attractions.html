                                hectares of land. It
                                is bounded in the southern corner by Vesnina Street in the east - Sumska Street to the
                                north - the so-called elite private settlement construction, and in the west - Dynamo
                                street corner and Novgorod.<br>
                                The origin of the park was from the City governing council who "put forth a proposition
                                to plant trees on 20-40,000 square metres on both sides of the Sumskoy road" The idea
                                was that the area would be used for horse riding in a similar manner to the Boulogne
                                Forest. Teachers, university students, and school students all assisted voluntarily with
                                the tree planting. Each tree had a plaque planted next to it showing who had planted it.

                                The garden was laid out in 1804-1805 by Vasiliy Nazarovich Karazin, the founder of
                                Kharkov University. The garden was laid out in a natural oak grove on the outskirts of
                                the city. On the upper terrace is a landscape park, on the lower - the botanical park.
                                Since its inception, the garden was called the University Garden. In 1808 in the garden
                                was built astronomical observatory. In 1896 in the western end of the park was opened
